# Tweeter Project

This is an AJAX-based twitter clone, it operates on a single page and makes use of jQuery as well as HTML. The project also uses CSS style templates to format the webpage design.
Once cloned from git hub make sure to run NPM install to download all necessary resources! After that all you need to do is console npm start and your server will be ready. You may also change the server port within the index.js file, enjoy!
